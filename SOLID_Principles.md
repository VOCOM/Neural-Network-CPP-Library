*SOLID Principles to follow*

`Single-Responsibility Principle`\
Each object should be responsible for only one job.

`Open-Closed Principle`\
Keep all objects open for extension while being closed to modification.

`Liskov  Substitution Principle`\
Child classes should be substitutable for its parent class.

`Interface Segregation Principle`\
Seperate object interactions using interfaces instead of inheritance.

`Dependency Inversion Principle`\
High-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
